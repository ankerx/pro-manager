**CommonMark + GFM Specifications**

Today _CommonMark_ is the de-facto _Markdown_ standard. _GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)_ is another popular specification based on _CommonMark_ - maintained by _GitHub_, which is the _Markdown_ mostly used. TOAST UI Editor follows both [_CommonMark_](http://commonmark.org/) and [_GFM_](https://github.github.com/gfm/) specifications. Write documents with ease using productive tools provided by TOAST UI Editor and you can easily open the produced document wherever the specifications are supported.

- **Live Preview** : Edit Markdown while keeping an eye on the rendered HTML. Your edits will be applied immediately.
- **Scroll Sync** : Synchronous scrolling between Markdown and Preview. You don't need to scroll through each one separately.
